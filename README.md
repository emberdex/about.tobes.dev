# Toby's About Me Page

This page exists to help my colleagues and others I have a professional relationship with know how I work best.

**This project is my very first full project in React - there may be jankiness ahead, and none of the code in this repo should be taken to represent good React/TypeScript coding practices.** That said, this project is MIT licensed, so feel free to derive from its contents as you please.

### TODO:

- Document bring-up.
